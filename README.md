# Raspberrypuree/UserLink
going on from [Ducklinks](https://github.com/kaichanvong/ducklinks), adds the user markdown link.

Raspberrypuree links the RaspberryMark from a user '@' ("blowing a raspberry") to get their Username and creates a Userlink (in Markdown form).

`@kaichanvong` could be @[kaichanvong](https://github.com/kaichanvong) `# @[kaichanvong](https://github.com/kaichanvong)` 

## Why Tests? 
Should be fairly self-explanatory. If there are no tests, it's really scary!

## Huh? Ducklinks
I know. I don't really know. But I know where you're going with that. If you want, hire me. Also, the author of Ducklinks is awesome. 

## I didnt get the whole markdown thing...
I know. Readme is difficult. It's in the source. I'm quite into moving away from HTML now and then. Same in certain video games. It can be nicer. Turn off that setting in that video game. For goodness sayings!
