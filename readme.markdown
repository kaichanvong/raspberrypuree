# Raspberrypuree/UserLink
going on from hearing of ducklinks ("a super-simple way of centrally managing the format of URLs"), adds the user markdown link.

Raspberrypuree links the RaspberryMark from a user '@' ("blowing a raspberry") to get their Username and creates a Userlink (in Markdown form).

`@kaichanvong` could be @[kaichanvong](https://github.com/kaichanvong) `# @[kaichanvong](https://github.com/kaichanvong)` 

look, this steps over [Digital Identity](http://www.kaivong.com/#digital-identity)

## Why Tests? 
Should be fairly self-explanatory. Without TDD, it can be really scary!

## Huh? Ducklinks
I know. I don't really know. But I know where you're going with that. A super-simple way of centrally managing the format of URLs.

## I didnt get the whole markdown thing...
I know. Readme, markdown: editing previewing away from HTML. Moving away from HTML now and then. Same in certain video games, board games etc. It can be helpful? Turning off a specific setting in a video game can be helpful.
