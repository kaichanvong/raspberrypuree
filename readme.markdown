# RaspberryPuree/UsernameLink
going on from hearing of ducklinks ("a super-simple way of centrally managing the format of URLs"); **RaspberryPuree** for users (markdown link); raspberrypuree '@' ("blowing a raspberry") for the UserName, then creates UsernameLink (in .Markdown format)

## example
`@kaichanvong` could-be--for @[kaichanvong](https://github.com/kaichanvong) `# @[kaichanvong](https://github.com/kaichanvong)` 
This steps over to [Digital Identity](https://kaichanvong.github.io/#digitalIdentityContent); where each service has the RaspberryPuree alongside UsernameLink

## markdown?
editing previews away from HTML (can be helpful) given the notation
